Scope 1:
Library to pick crucial data
	- process stats for the component
	- JVM stats
	- memory stats
	
XML definition of profiles
Properties extract
Log file extract (current, days , full)
Known mounts, Email
zip - protect
Same machine 
One Component

Engine

JVMTask - Implements process , Memory stats
PropertyExportTask - Pick property values , Sofwtare version
DBInfoTask - DB version, data installer version, Patch level, DBMS logs etc
LogExportTask (how many days)- Pick log data
TableExportTask (Custom query) - embedded by dev when creating profile, pass in from UI
DBDumpTask - Dump DB info
EnvVarTask - Pick deployment Server info

Invoke tasks as per profile (always have generic tasks)
	
trails-service - rest
	REST Server
		-	getProfiles?componentId=vcm
		- 	submitRequest(vcm, profileId,string[]) - to JMS

	Scheduler
		- generate context and call engine entity	
	
trails-web - UI

trails-engine 
	Task handlers
		
Property File
**************

baseDir
transport
	-	smtp host / smtp port
	-	FTP details
	- 	shared file system
	
Profile XML
	- Component Name
	- baseDir (override)
	- Properties Path
	- log path
	- enable / disable on each (default enable)
	- transport per task.

Scope 3
Scheduling of profiles
Plugin demo


CISCO TRAILS – TRoubleshooting AnalysIs and Log Syndication

Start with VCM Server /VCM UI

Setup:
Appropriate mounts available to stuff
Software definition
generic XML that will be defined for the project (custom queries)

Provides framework
-	Each component defines it params in the generic XML
-	Make reports from profile
-	Make reports on given queries

Provides UI Control
-	Prepare report
-	Decipher report
o	Asks password Or
o	Tries  to use the configured certificate
-	Upload certificate per application (for Public Crypt)

Report  Default
	Environment variables
Software Version
Deployment server info
	Database Version / patch level

Take DB dumps
Give a spreadsheet report of selected table Data.
Take logs (possibly by filter)
Take System Java memory statistics

Profiles :
Item 1 : Give me all logs
Item 2 : Give me specific logs

Profile 1 : Item1 + Item2
Profile 2 : Item1 + item4

Profiles can have parameters that need to be submitted.

Prepare reports based on chosen profile and zip it. 

Options to user :

Possibly encrypted zip to avoid data theft on transmission – password set by preparer
	Or
We can also try public cryptography support – encrypt with Cisco Tool public key (only can be decrypted within)


Scheduled / automated reports should be supported (examples - > send log of JVM to check leaks, Stats of how a certain table is filling up)
Support Email functionality
Support for Drop on accessible storage
Support for FTP

Notes:
This tool can be used for QC labs, Integration labs, Production labs
One tool can work with any number of onsite software’s
May use puppet like infrastructure underneath
